      <p>
        That's what we'll be doing here. Step by step, we will take two audio
        signals and combine them the way a channel vocoder would here in the
        browser.

        <h3>What are we vocoding?</h3>
        <p>
          A vocoder needs at least two signals: A carrier signal and an
          "information" signal. The information signal is usually speech, and
          the carrier signal is usually a harmonically rich signal, like a
          sawtooth wave or a cello recording.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the original communication context, the goal was to faithfully
          recreate the original information signal, and so a carrier signal was
          chosen to optimize for that. Here, we want an "interesting" result
          signal, one which resembles speech but also has the "pitched"
          qualities of the carrier.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        I've chosen a bassoon snippet for the carrier signal and a recording of
        me talking for the information signal. <b>Listen to them.</b>

        <h3>Info channel signals</h3>
        <p>
          The first step is to filter the carrier signal so that we get rid of
          the frequencies in ranges that aren't relevant to speech and keep the
          ones that are. Dudley's original vocoder retained frequencies centered
          around 112.5, 337.5, 575, 850, 1200, 1700, 2350, 3250, 4600, and 6450
          Hz. We're just going to use six of these, dropping 112.5, 3250, 4600,
          and 6450, just because that seems to work fine and is less work for
          the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we run
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band-pass_filter"
            >bandpass filters</a
          >
          centered at those frequencies, we'll get six separate signals
          containing only frequencies near those six centers (337.5, 575, 850,
          1200, 1700, and 2350 Hz). These are the "channels" referred to by the
          name "channel vocoder."
        </p>
        <p>
          How near the frequencies must be to the centers of the bandpasses is
          determined by the Q value. Q is the narrowness of the bandpasses. The
          higher the Q, the narrower the frequency band.

          Next, we're going to run an
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="http://musicweb.ucsd.edu/~mpuckette/techniques/v0.05/book-html/node142.html"
            >envelope follower</a
          >
          on these channel signals. An envelope follower measures the average
          power of a signal. It's called an "envelope follower" because it
          produces an envelope that follows the shape of the signal.
        </p>
        <p>
          This averaging produces a signal that is smoother, meaning that it
          jumps up and down less abruptly. (If we were going to use this for
          communication, this would be nice because a signal with less
          meaningful detail in it can be represented by a smaller amount of
          data.)
        </p>
        <p>
          We're not calculating straight averages, though; we have weights,
          called smoothing factors, on how much quickly a rise in the signal
          should affect the average and how quickly a fall should affect it.
          With these we can affect output's the sensitivity to attack and decay
          in the input.

            Now we're getting into the synthesis part of the process. The
            previous steps extracted information from the input signals. Now
            we'll put them together. First, we'll modulate the carrier channel
            signals with the envelope signals (which we got by running the
            envelope follower on the information channel signals).
          </p>
          <p>
            By modulating, I mean multiplying. Every sample in the carrier
            signal will get multiplied by its corresponding sample in the
            envelope signal to produce the sample result signal. For example, if
            we had extremely short signals that each had five samples, the
            modulation would look like this:
